#What is Simple MVC Framework?

Simple MVC Framework is a PHP 5.3 MVC system. It's designed to be lightweight and modular, allowing developers to build better and easy to maintain code with PHP.

The base framework comes with a few helper classes, this is to keep code bloat down to a minimum. Classes can easily be added at any stage of development.

##Requirements
 - PHP 5.3 or newer
 - Linux Hosting due to mod-rewrite support

## Installation

1. Unzip the package.
2. Upload the framework files to your server. Normally the index.php file will be at your root.
3. Open the index.php file with a text editor and set your base URL and database credentials. Set the default theme and controller to be loaded.

## Acknowledgement

I'd like to thank [Jessie](http://jream.com/) from jream.com, for producing an excellent video series on making an MVC system, this framework was evolved from that foundation.
